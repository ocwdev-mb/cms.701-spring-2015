Participation – 15%
-------------------

Prior to each session, students will be required to devise a thoughtful and open-ended question (a minimum of five sentences in length) that engages with at last one of the assigned readings and that focuses on one key theme or argument that they find provoking and worthy of further examination and discussion.

Class Presentation – 35%
------------------------

Each week, one student will have to prepare a 30-minute presentation on a media artifact (film, TV show, website, video game, music album, magazine, news article, podcast, blog, meme, etc.) or an event (news coverage, presidential debate, release of a new technology, digital action, etc.) in relation to the topic of that week. In addition to describing the object, the student will present an analysis of its economic, cultural, social, ethical, or political significance in relation to the assigned readings. The presentation will be followed by a 20-minute period of questions and discussion that the student will have to facilitate. A transcript of the presentation (7–10 pages) has to be submitted to the instructor one day before the presentation, and a hardcopy of the transcript (1 inch margins, 1½ spaced, Times New Roman, size 12) has to be submitted in class before the presentation.
