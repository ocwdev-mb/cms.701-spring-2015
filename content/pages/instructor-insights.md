## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _CMS.701 Current Debates in Media_ as it was taught by Dr. Gabrielle Trépanier-Jobin in Spring 2015.

This class addresses important, current debates in media with in-depth discussion of popular perceptions and policy implications. Students engage in the critical study of the economic, political, social, and cultural significance of media, and learn to identify, analyze, and understand the complex relations among media texts, policies, institutions, industries, and infrastructures. The class offers the opportunity to discuss, in stimulating and challenging ways, topics such as ideology, propaganda, net neutrality, big data, digital hacktivism, digital rebellion, media violence, gamification, collective intelligence, participatory culture, intellectual property, artificial intelligence, etc., from historical, transcultural, and multiple methodological perspectives. Students examine the framing of these issues, their ethical and policy implications, as well as strategies for repositioning the debates.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

1. Demonstrate, through oral presentations, discussions, and written works, an understanding of the current debates in media

## Instructor Insights

_Below, Dr. Gabrielle Trépanier-Jobin shares the pedagogical tools and methods she used to teach each session of CMS.701 Current Debates in Media._

### ► Session 1: Ideologies, Stereotypes, & Agency

Students worked in teams of 3-4 to create a conceptual map of different sections from Stuart Hall’s (2004) text “Culture, the Media and the ‘Ideological Effect’” with the help of the software [_CmapTools_](http://cmap.ihmc.us/). The best conceptual maps were presented to the rest of the class.

### ► Session 2: Propaganda, Censorship, & Net Neutrality

Students were introduced to propaganda techniques and were asked to identify them in a series of images or videos.

### ► Session 3: Violence in Media and Video Games

Students worked in teams to prepare an argumentation for or against the idea that: 1) media violence is exaggerated, 2) more regulations should be implemented to control media violence and 3) violence in video games is more problematic than violence in films or television shows.

### ► Session 4: From Big Data to Big Brother: Surveillance and Privacy in the Information Age

Students worked in teams of 3-4 to identify rhetorical strategies in Google’s, Facebook’s, Twitter’s, Amazon’s, Netflix’s, Skype’s, Instagram’s, and YouTube’s Terms and Services that work ideologically to downplay privacy risks and make the users believe that decisions were made for their own good.

### ► Session 5: Digital Hacktivism, Civil Disobedience, & Piracy

The cases of Anonymous, WikiLeaks, Edward Snowden, and Aaron Swartz were explored through online videos and class discussions.

### ► Session 6: Digital Rebellion, Direct Democracy, & Cyber Left

A guest speaker who was involved in an online resistance movement was invited to answer questions about the use of digital media as alternative media outlets, aggregators, emotional conduits and organizing tools, as well as questions about the obstacles to and disadvantages of online resistance. The conversation with the guest speaker was recorded and made available on the class website.

### Session 7: GamerGate Controversy

After providing an overview of gender representations in video games, one student presented the perspective and arguments of the gamergaters, while another student presented the perspective and arguments of the female game designers and feminist scholars who were attacked by the gamergaters.

### ► Session 8: From Gamification to Gamepocalypse

An expert in gamification was invited to explain the concept and discuss issues such as surveillance, governmentality, disciplinary practices, techniques of the self, etc. The conversation with the guest speaker was recorded and made available to the students on the class website.

### ► Session 9: Socialization and Intimacy in Digital Environments

The software [_Mentimeter_](https://www.mentimeter.com/) was used to interact with the students and ask their opinion on different issues about socialization and intimacy in digital environments.

### ► Session 10: Collective Intelligence versus the Expert Paradigm

After being introduced to the concept of collective intelligence and seeing how it applies to Wikipedia, students worked in teams of 3-4 to create a conceptual map of different sections from Jean Goodwin's (2009) text “The Authority of Wikipedia” with the help of the software _CmapTools_. The best conceptual maps were presented to the rest of the class.

### ► Session 11: Participatory Culture, Intellectual Property, & Media Panic

Students were asked to find the most eloquent example of participatory culture before coming to class and post the link on the class website. After defining participatory culture and providing an overview of the debates around it, students worked in teams of 3-4 to determine whose example was the most relevant and shared their explanation with the rest of the class.

### ► Session 12: Artificial Intelligence, Posthumanism, & Technological Apocalypse

After introducing the concepts of artificial intelligence, machine learning and posthumanism, as well as the social context in which they developed, a series of technological innovations were presented to the students and our society’s fear of technological apocalypse were illustrated with movies such as _Blade Runner_, _Her_, and _Transcendence_.
